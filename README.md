# [NPC] Emerald Trader

<img src="https://github.com/mvarken/_NPC_Emerald-Trader/blob/main/NPC%20Trader.jpg" width="250" height="250">

An NPC that allows you to trade items for other items, similar to a Piglin.
In my script, I use emeralds to trade for random items.
There are no commands in this script; it is an NPC assignment for Citizen NPC's with addon Denizen.
